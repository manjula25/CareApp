 * Graph-level state for the S4 agent-graph canvas (Orchestrator + 4 agent

 * `useAnalysisGraph` below) — a pure fixture of SSE events (no explicit
 * `start`) skips straight from `idle` to `dispatch` on its first event,
 * since there's no separate "stream opened" SSE frame to key off of.
 *
 * `dispatch` is the exact tick the very first event of the run arrives
 * (any agentId, any event type) — the moment the backend has clearly
 * started dispatching work to the agents. Every event after that first one
 * (while risk/careGap/sdoh are still working) promotes the graph to
 * `analyzing`. `synthesizing` fires on actionPlanner's first tagged event
 * (per the Event→state contract, actionPlanner only starts once the three
 * parallel agents have already produced their structured results, so its
 * first event is the unambiguous parallel→synthesis pivot). `complete`
 * fires only on the terminal `done` event — there is no single unified
 * "complete" event in the real SSE vocabulary, just four per-agent ones.
